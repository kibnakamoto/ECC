Jul 16, 2022

# Algorithms:

Elliptic Cryptography Integrated Encrypton Scheme

Elliptic Cryptography Digital Signature Algorithm

ECDSA Public Key Recovery from SEC 1, ver 1.9, section 4.1.6

Hash-based Message Authentication Code

Advanced Encryption Standard

512-bit Secure Hashing Algorithm

Only Weiestress curve is used

Only prime field sizes are supported

Curves: secp521r1, secp256k1 (Bitcoin Curve), secp256r1

Not For Professional use

Note: Public Key Recovery doesn't always work, further tests will be done

Currently, further improvements on Public Key Recovery as well as support of Binary Galois Fields
GF(2^m) is being implemented
